In this article, we will learn how to make an 8Ã—8 Neo-pixel Face mask using an ESP-01 wireless module and how to control it via WLED firmware. The WS2812 LEDs are easy to use and work on almost every IoT module. I will be using 60 led's/m strips in this project and the total count of LEDs will be 64.

The circuit is powered by a 3.7 V battery with a battery recharging module and a couple of switches. The effects and colors will be controlled through WIFI via the WLED HTML page on various devices.

Supplies
1.Soldering Iron

2.Wires

3.Pushbuttons or Slideswitch

4.Heat shrink tubes

5.Transperant insulating tape

6.Hot Air Gun

7.Velcro

8.Dark coloured cloth ( I will be using Black colour cloth )

9.Flat Elastic thread

Step 1: Making Mask

Making Mask
Making Mask
Make a face mask using any dark-colored cloth.
I have used a black color cloth.
Sew it as per your requirement and size.
Make a pocket-like section for inserting the LED matrix.
During the daytime, this section can be used to put a filter inside it.
Since it is made up of cloth so it is washable and reusable.
Add Velcro at inserting section by which we can insert the matrix in the section.

Setting Up Esp-01 and Programming
Programming ESP-01 using NodeMCU software or Arduino IDE. Use the bin file for flashing after flashing don't forget to restart the module.

Step 3: Soldering

Before soldering components please do check on a multimeter that all components are working fine because more than 4 V can damage the esp-01 module.
Soldering all the components as given in the schematics/circuit diagram.
After soldering cover all soldering points using insulating tape or heat shrink tubes to avoid a shock circuit.
Do the connections as following
Data In pin ==> GPIO2
5v ===> Vin of LD1117
GND ==> GND of LD1117
LD1117 3.3v Vout ====> ESP-01 VCC and EN/CH_PD pins
TP4056 output ===> LD1117 Vin
TP4056 GND===> LD1117 GND
Battery +ve ===> TP4056 input
Battery -ve ===> TP4056 GND
Please connect buttons between battery and LD1117 as well as in between GPIO2 and Data In pin of LEDs.

Now only power up the esp-01 and keep the GPIO2 ==>LED Data In off.
As shown in the above pictures you will see the Default Access point name of esp-01 As WLED-AP.
Its default password will be wled1234.
We can change the Access Point name and password as per our requirement.
The HTML page will open up automatically and by using this page we can set up the number of LEDs.
Now choose the color and effect.
After choosing the color we can turn on the data pin switch (if we turn on both the switches then the access point will not be visible) .

We have successfully built our LED face mask.
Charge the battery at a healthy capacity use the battery charging module indicator light (ona full charge it will turn blue)
Now put the Neo-pixel LED matrix in the pocket section of the mask.
Now we can glow in the dark.
